        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="media/author.jpg">
        <p>My name is John Landers, and I am the owner and writer for this blog. I am a senior
            in computer science at Michigan State University. I was born and have lived in Plainfield, Illinois
            for my entire life, minus a small amount for attending Michigan State University. I love all things
            computers, from programing, design, and gaming!
        </p>
        <p>I have never written nor worked for a blog or writing company in the past. This is my first endeavour into
            blogging and I have been very excited to bring interesting posts and content to all you readers! I originally began
            this blog while studying at Michigan State during a class about Web Design in 2023! I will continue working on and 
            growing this website for as long as I can!
        </p>
