        <p>By: <b>John Landers</b></p>
        <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to my blog! This is my first of many blog posts on my new page, and I hope
            that all of you will stick with me as I continuously work on my blog site! Please bare with me as I get 
            used to this new blog concept. If you are curious to learn more about me, please visit the "About" page 
            to read more about myself!
        </p>
        <p>According to my friend's research, my website may expect to see the following numbers as time and our website progresses:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Days</th>
                <th>Readers</th>
                <th>Posts</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>30</td>
                <td>50</td>
                <td>5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>100</td>
                <td>1000</td>
                <td>15</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Some may say those are pretty modest numbers, but I think it is still positive growth! I am excited to see what will come
            from my blog! If you have any suggestions, question, or comments, please contact me by navigating to the Contact page! 
            I would love to hear from all of you readers!

        <h2>Why Computer Science is Awesome</h2>

        <p>Computer Science is the backbone for the research and development of modern technology. Without it, we wouldn't be able
            to have smartphones, laptops, complex programs and games, and more! It even drives the technology behind airplanes!
        </p>
        <p>Above, you can see the screenshot from Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The game didn't always work and look the way
            that it does now, though. It took a lot of development, in various areas of computer software and hardware technology, 
            to make this possible! If you think about it, computer science is behind everything! Even your clocks, cash registers, 
            cars, and many other things that don't exactly have touch screens. It makes everything work the way that it does!
        </p>
        <p>But, is computer science going too far? With the rise of AI, some of us are becoming worried about a potential takeover of 
            robots. I say, fear not. I think we are still very far from this. What are your thoughts? Let me know on my contact page!
